_Date: Monday Feb 09 2026_

We are introducing Conditional Trigger Orders, a new order type that allows you to place orders based on specific market conditions. Also, we are introducing P&L based exit under Trader's control along with an Exit All API. These APIs are built to provide you with more flexibility and control over your trades. We have also enhanced our Option Chain API offering for you.

### Improvements

    We have enhanced the rate limits for Option Chain API - you can now make multiple unique requests for option chain data for different expiry dates and strikes, each within 3 seconds. Along with this, we have also added new fields to the response - `average_price` and `security_id` - [here](/docs/v2/option-chain/#option-chain_1).

  

## Version 2.4

_Date: Monday Sep 22 2025_

In line with the changes in SEBI guidelines on Retail Participation in Algorithmic Trading, we are bringing changes to the authentication module - primarily in 3 areas - reduced Access Token duration, API Key based authentication and IP setup.

### New Features

You can now use this method to generate API key for one year validity and generate new access token daily by verifying your Dhan credentials. You can read more about the same [here](/docs/v2/authentication/#api-key-secret).

### Breaking Changes

-   **Access Token can only be generated for 24 hours**  
    Access token based authentication will only be allowed for 24 hours after generating token. This is in line with the exchange and SEBI guidelines on management of API access.
    
-   **Static IP Requirement**  
    Static IP is required for all Order APIs for placing, modifying and cancelling any type of orders - including normal orders, super orders and forever orders. You can setup IP directly via API as per the [.Setup Static IP APIs](/docs/v2/authentication/#setup-static-ip).
    

  

## Version 2.3

We are adding one of the most requested data on APIs - 200 Market Depth on Websockets and historical expired options contract data. Along with this, we are changing rate limit for Order APIs to 10 order per second, in accordance with regulations.

### New Features

    You can get depth upto 200 levels directly on websocket - an extension of 20 Market Depth with more data so you can design trading system on top of more data and find our opportunity zones seamlessly. You can read more about how this will work [here](/docs/v2/full-market-depth/#200-level).
    
-   **Historical Options Data**  
    This endpoint is built for you to fetch options data of expired contracts, on a rolling basis. You do not need to look for the security ID for expired contracts, rather you can enter strikes as ATM +/- to fetch data.

DhanHQ v2 extends execution capability with live order updates and forever orders on superfast APIs. Along with this, we also released Market Quote APIs, built on top of Live Market Feed which can be integrated with ease. We have also introduced improvements, bug fixes and increased stability with new version.

### New Features

-   **Market Quote**  
    Fetch LTP, Quote (with OI) and Market Depth data directly on API, for upto 1000 instruments at once with [Market Quote API](/docs/v2/market-quote).

-   **Margin Calculator**  
    Margin Calculation simplifies order placement by providing details about required margin and available balances before placing order - [Margin Calculator API](/docs/v2/funds/#margin-calculator).
    

### Improvements

-   **Intraday Historical Data**  
    Intraday Historical Data now provides OHLC with Volume data for last 5 trading days across timeframes such as 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 25 min and 60 min - [Intraday Historical Data API](/docs/v2/historical-data/#intraday-historical-data).
    
-   **GET Order APIs**  
    `filledQty`, `remainingQuantity` and `averageTradedPrice` is available as part of all GET Order APIs, which makes it simpler to fetch post execution details of an order. We have also added `PART_TRADED` as a flag on `orderStatus` which will be clear distinction for partially traded orders.

    You can now authorise [Live Market Feed](/docs/v2/live-market-feed/) via Query Parameters and subscribe/unsubscribe to instruments via JSON messages on websockets with this version. Also, `FULL` packet is now available which will gives LTP, Quote, OI and Market Depth data in a single packet.
    

### Breaking Changes

-   **Order Placement**  
    Deprecated non-mandatory request keys including `tradingSymbol`, `drvExpiryDate`, `drvOptionType` and `drvStrikePrice` from Order Placement API endpoints. Along with this, pre-open AMO orders can also be placed now with `PRE_OPEN` tag.
    
-   **Order Modification**  
    `quantity` field needs to be placed order quantity instead of pending order quantity. Earlier, for Order Modification API, in case of partial execution, user needed to pass pending order quantity, which led to errors due to simultaneous execution on exchange or need to call GET Trade APIs as well. `quantity` and `price` fields are conditionally required for modification.
    
    `quantity` field in Order Modification
    
-   **Daily Historical Data**  
    `symbol` is replaced with `securityId` as key in Daily Historical Data, making it simple for users to fetch data everywhere with Security ID itself - [Daily Historical Data API](/docs/v2/historical-data/#daily-historical-data).

    Security ID List is now comprehensive with tag changes as well. Check new mappings and description - [Security ID List](/docs/v2/instruments).
    
-   **Epoch time introduced instead of Julian time in Historical Data APIs** - Timestamp in [Daily Historical Data API](/docs/v2/historical-data/#daily-historical-data) and [Intraday Historical Data API](/docs/v2/historical-data/#intraday-historical-data) is now Epoch or UNIX time and with key `timestamp`.
    
-   **`Market Depth` deprecated as mode in Live Market Feed**  
    `Market Depth` mode is now replaced with `FULL` packet which has combined data of Quote, OI and market depth in single packet, enabling ease in subscribing and fetching data.
    
-   **Change in endpoint for Trade History and Kill Switch**  
    New endpoint for Trade History is `/trades`, making it common with other Trade book APIs. For Kill Switch, the new endpoint as per nomenclature is `killswitch`.
    

### Bug Fixes

-   **`realizedProfit` and `unrealizedProfit` in Positions API**  
    You can now get realtime values of `realizedProfit` and `unrealizedProfit` on [Positions API](/docs/v2/portfolio/#positions).
