# Instrument List

You can fetch instrument list for all instruments which can be traded via Dhan by using below URL:

**Compact:**

```
https://images.dhan.co/api-data/api-scrip-master.csv
```

**Detailed:**

```
https://images.dhan.co/api-data/api-scrip-master-detailed.csv
```

This fetches list of instruments as CSV with Security ID and other important details which will help you build with DhanHQ APIs.

### Segmentwise List

You can fetch detailed instrument list for all instruments in a particular exchange and segment by passing the same in parameters as below:

```
curl --location 'https://api.dhan.co/v2/instrument/{exchangeSegment}' \
```

> This helps to fetch instrument list of only one particular `exchangeSegment` at a time. The mapping of the same can be found [here](/docs/v2/annexure/#exchange-segment).
