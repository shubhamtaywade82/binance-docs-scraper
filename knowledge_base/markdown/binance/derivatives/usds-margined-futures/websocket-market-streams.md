# Websocket Market Streams

-   The connection method for Websocket is：
    -   Base Url: **wss://fstream.binance.com**
    -   Three routed endpoints are available based on data type:
        -   **Public** (high-frequency public market data): `wss://fstream.binance.com/public`
        -   **Market** (regular market data): `wss://fstream.binance.com/market`
        -   **Private** (user data): `wss://fstream.binance.com/private`
    -   Two access modes are supported:
        -   `ws` mode: streams are composed in the URL path — **/ws/<streamName>**
        -   `stream` mode: streams are passed via query parameters — **/stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>/<streamName3>**
    -   Examples:
        -   `wss://fstream.binance.com/market/ws/bnbusdt@aggTrade`
        -   `wss://fstream.binance.com/public/ws/bnbusdt@depth/ethusdt@depth`
        -   `wss://fstream.binance.com/market/stream?streams=bnbusdt@aggTrade/btcusdt@markPrice`

> **Important:** Connections that do not include a routed path (`/public`, `/market`, or `/private`) will only receive data from the **Public** endpoint. Streams belonging to `/market` or `/private` will not push data on unrouted connections. For example, `wss://fstream.binance.com/ws/btcusdt@depth` will continue to work (since `@depth` belongs to `/public`), but `wss://fstream.binance.com/ws/btcusdt@markPrice` will not (since `@markPrice` belongs to `/market`). See [Important WebSocket Change Notice](https://developers.binance.com/docs/derivatives/usds-margined-futures/websocket-market-streams/Important-WebSocket-Change-Notice) for the full stream-to-endpoint mapping and migration details.

-   Combined stream events are wrapped as follows: **{"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>}**
-   All symbols for streams are **lowercase**
-   A single connection is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark
-   The websocket server will send a `ping frame` every 3 minutes. If the websocket server does not receive a `pong frame` back from the connection within a 10 minute period, the connection will be disconnected. Unsolicited `pong frames` are allowed(the client can send pong frames at a frequency higher than every 15 minutes to maintain the connection).
-   WebSocket connections have a limit of 10 incoming messages per second.
-   A connection that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected; IPs that are repeatedly disconnected may be banned.
-   A single connection can listen to a maximum of **1024** streams.
-   Considering the possible data latency from RESTful endpoints during an extremely volatile market, it is highly recommended to get the order status, position, etc from the Websocket user data stream.
