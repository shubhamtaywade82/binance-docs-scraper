> - support querying futures trade histories that are not older than 24 hours
> - If both `startTime` and `endTime` are sent, time between `startTime` and `endTime` must be less than 1 hour.
> - If `fromId`, `startTime`, and `endTime` are not sent, the most recent aggregate trades will be returned.
> - Only market trades will be aggregated and returned, which means the insurance fund trades and ADL trades won't be aggregated.
