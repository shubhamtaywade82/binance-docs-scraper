# Filters

Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange.

## Symbol filters

### PRICE\_FILTER

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```json
{
  "filterType": "PRICE_FILTER",
  "minPrice": "0.00000100",
  "maxPrice": "100000.00000000",
  "tickSize": "0.00000100"
}
```

The `PRICE_FILTER` defines the `price` rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

-   `minPrice` defines the minimum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `minPrice` == 0.
-   `maxPrice` defines the maximum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `maxPrice` == 0.
-   `tickSize` defines the intervals that a `price`/`stopPrice` can be increased/decreased by; disabled on `tickSize` == 0.

Any of the above variables can be set to 0, which disables that rule in the `price filter`. In order to pass the `price filter`, the following must be true for `price`/`stopPrice` of the enabled rules:

-   `price` >= `minPrice`
-   `price` <= `maxPrice`
-   (`price`\-`minPrice`) % `tickSize` == 0

### LOT\_SIZE

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```json
{
  "filterType": "LOT_SIZE",
  "minQty": "0.00100000",
  "maxQty": "100000.00000000",
  "stepSize": "0.00100000"
}
```

The `LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

-   `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
-   `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
-   `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

-   `quantity` >= `minQty`
-   `quantity` <= `maxQty`
-   (`quantity`\-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

### MARKET\_LOT\_SIZE

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```json
{
  "filterType": "MARKET_LOT_SIZE",
  "minQty": "0.00100000",
  "maxQty": "100000.00000000",
  "stepSize": "0.00100000"
}
```

The `MARKET_LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for `MARKET` orders on a symbol. There are 3 parts:

-   `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
-   `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
-   `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `market lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

-   `quantity` >= `minQty`
-   `quantity` <= `maxQty`
-   (`quantity`\-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

### MAX\_NUM\_ORDERS

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```json
{
  "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ORDERS",
  "limit": 200
}
```

The `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.

Note that both "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.

### PERCENT\_PRICE

> **/exchangeInfo format:**

```json
{
  "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE",
  "multiplierUp": "1.0500",
  "multiplierDown": "0.9500",
  "multiplierDecimal": 4
}
```

The `PERCENT_PRICE` filter defines valid range for a price based on the mark price.

In order to pass the `percent price`, the following must be true for `price`:

-   BUY: `price` <= `markPrice` \* `multiplierUp`
-   SELL: `price` >= `markPrice` \* `multiplierDown`
